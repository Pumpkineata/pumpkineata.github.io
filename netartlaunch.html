    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
    <p title="Artist Statement">
        I choose five sentences or themes for The NET.ART Project, I was looking for all the sentences to have a similar theme of how I see society at this moment. I wanted to have a more poetic tone and I didn't expect anyone to understand/grasp the meaning behind the sentences just by looking at the artwork or sentences especially due to the words being taken from a random list of words from articles online. The first net art, Washington’s Grove, was about society taking over or disrupting nature for the government or for industrial advances, which in a way isn't always bad but can destroy the wildlife and their habitats if done regularly or without care. The second sentence, Bright spring and few Sorrow, is about society actually being afraid of change and of peace, and in the process, causing more sorrow because deep down they like the feeling of suffering and are afraid of true growth, which spring brings growth. The third sentence, Released Public, is suppose to represent the imprisonment people can feel from releasing their strength and energy into society and allowing society to dictate who they are as a person, kind of like an oxymoron; A person being let out of jail but still being confined by the officers...believing one is free to be who they want in the public eye but actually being less of who they want to be so they can fit in. The fourth net art, Shutting Down the Area, is about how when something is small or hidden away from the mass media or the average people it can be taken over as soon as it is discovered by the masses, it is run down and ruined in some way for others. It’s not always ruined but...the world has a way of turning something good  into a warzone. My final netartwork is my favorite in meaning, The remote and convenient, I use to be addicted to social media, instagram, twitter... anything that took me away from how boring my life felt. I hated being on social media but couldn’t stay off. All year of 2020, I had to step back, not just because of fear of covid or how screwed the world felt but because I realized I was wasting my life away and not paying attention to what I had been blessed with. I have always hated this age of technology, the constant mindless scrolling, and it didn't help my ADD. After putting my phone down, something dawned on me, that even though everyone was just a click away, they were far away, another oxymoron. No one was really there at all, the people going through the phone in the escalator is my representation of how I society at this point. The black figures in the background to me are people that have let themselves fall into the trance and are just empty vessels, because that's how I felt as well. I had fun making this project, I didn't want it to be too silly...I really like making art that tells a story or that expresses my inner thoughts. I hope these netarts inspire someone and opens up their eyes just a little. :> </p>
