<p style="background-color: antiquewhite; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">For my Project, I was supposed to create three pictures that used outside images from online to create a self portrait of the mind, body, and spirit.  The pictures used were images  that had the usage rights of the creative commons or free use  for others. 
 In the beginning, I had a problem with expressing myself for two reasons for one,  knowing that I wouldn't be able to find any picture from just googling without checking if its fair use or not was excruciating. The second thing was I had a very hard time expressing who I was in word form when I was writing and sketching my thoughts of who I was mind wise, body wise and spirit wise. I'm still learning who I am and it was very hard for me to put it in image form. After I sat down and actually drew out everything and decided that even if I didn't like it I would keep with the design because I didn't have time to keep changing it, It came out actually nice and I grew to love what I was seeing. 
At the end of the journey of discovering, It was actually created  fun artworks.I love how everything turned out and the colors that were used were really nice. It took a lot of brain power not to remake the entire thing in the beginning of the project but overall I think I did well with finding pictures that matched what I wanted in my head.
